This is a basic port scanner I have written. It is not very functional
yet, nor do I think it will ever be awash in functionality. It is being
written so as to help me teach myself the usages of sockets and network
connectivity. I am also going to try to learn how to do this with
threading at some point, as that is also an important topic to teach
myself.
